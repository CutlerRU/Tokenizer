# Tokenizer
Tokenizer Computer Architecture

Wow! This project really tested my ability to think in terms of C programming. At first I designed it to work with for loops and used the argvlist idea, but I realized later in that all the inputs had quotes "" around them which made it one large String. Let me start off by saying I wrote this program in an about 1 1/2 hours start to finish only a day before it was due. To be completely honest I was horrified that I was not going to make it happen. I felt so confused about C Programming, I had no idea what I was doing until all of a sudden it was like magic. Things started working, I used my knowledge from other class and applied them to C. By far one of the most rewarding experiences of programming I have had to date! This has really encouraged me to look at C in a whole new light. Although I really struggled at first, it all clicked and made sense when I really needed it.
